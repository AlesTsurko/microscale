Generated in real-time from random Wikipedia articles, **microscale** is a web-based, generative album, also available as a rendered physical CDR and digital download. Each article functions a step sequencer – where the letters are the sequencer steps and the track titles are regular expressions that switch the steps on and off. The web version is generated in real-time and is also hackable – the regular expressions, samples, tempo and other parameters can be edited or replaced – enabling **microscale** to be used as an instrument and sequencer for the listener’s own music.


The concept behind **microscale** is to show that through transforming one media (text) into another media (music), the meaning can be transformed – the article has its own meaning, but the music generated from the article has a completely different meaning.


**microscale** is available from http://alestsurko.by/microscale/. The physical version is available as individually rendered CDRs with every disc totally unique.
